# Obscurator

This is a small exercise in dealing with lists as arrays in python.
It is a small encryption app, that takes some text and scrambles it using a combination of caesar cipher, ascii-numbers and arrays.
The front end is using Tkinter

## How it works:
The string entered by the user, in the "Unobscured text"-box, will first be modulo-divided by 4. If there is a rest, a space-character will be added until the length of the string is divisible by 4.
Then, each character in the string will be substituted for its corresponding ascii-number + 3, and stored in two-dimentional list (array) with 4 columns. The number of rows depends on the length of the input. 

The input is stored from top left to right.

|1|2|3|4|
|---|---|---|----|
|5|6|7|8|
9|10|11|12|

The output is then generated by reading the ascii-numbers top to bottom, and substituting its corresponding character.

1,5,9,2,6,10,3,7,11,4,8,12
